# Video-Processing-OpenCV-Python
Real time processing of digital electricity meter videos to detect four units i.e. Volt, Ampere, Kilowatt, Kilowatt-Hour using OpenCV and Python.

For feature extraction SIFT, ORB algorithms were tried. Brute force and Flann based techniques were tried for feature matching. Then ratio test was used to extract good points.

### Challenges
Different resolutions of video will have different resolutions, which is still a problem to be dealt with.
An optimum average distance and lighting must be taken in consideration while capturing the video .
