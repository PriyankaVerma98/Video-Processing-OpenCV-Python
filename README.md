# Video-Processing-OpenCV-Python
Real time processing of digital electricity meter videos to detect four units i.e. Volt, Ampere, Kilowatt, Kilowatt-Hour using OpenCV and Python.

For feature extraction SIFT, ORB algorithms were tried. Brute force and Flann based techniques were tried for feature matching. Then ratio test was used to extract good points.
