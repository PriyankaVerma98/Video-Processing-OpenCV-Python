# Video-Processing-OpenCV-Python
Real time processing of digital electricity meter videos to detect four units- Volt, Ampere, Kilowatt, Kilowatt-Hour using OpenCV and Python.

Various algorithms like SIFT and ORB were tried for feature extraction. Brute force and Flann based techniques were tried for feature matching. Then ratio test was used to extract good points. 

***** 

### Feature Extraction and Matching 
Following images show the result of ORB with Flann technique.

### Scope

Earlier process to take the meter readings and generate bills involved a company official to make home visit, note down the reading then a bill is generated at the office and couriered to the home.

This project can help to digitalize electricity billing procedure. It will  save time and prevent human intervention and errors.
